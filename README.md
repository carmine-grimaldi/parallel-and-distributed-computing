# Parallel and Distributed Computing project
Repository for an academic project to implement different parallel sum strategies.
This project mainly focuses on the use of two apis: OpenMP and MPI. Both of them are for the C programming language, OpenMP is basically an API to help the programmer handle shared memory parallelism, whereas MPI is an API to handle distributed memory parallelism.
